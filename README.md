## Description
GPSNote is a mobile application designed to provide users with a convenient way to create and manage location-based notes. This application allows users to attach notes to specific GPS coordinates, ensuring that important information is associated with particular places. Whether it's a reminder for a particular location, a list of things to do when you're in a specific area, or any other context-specific note, GPSNote offers an intuitive platform to keep your notes organized based on your physical surroundings.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language:** C#
- **Framework:** .NET
- **Cross-Platform Development:** Xamarin

## Design Patterns
- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel):** GPSNote follows the MVVM architectural pattern, separating the user interface (View) from the application logic (ViewModel) and data management (Model). This separation enhances maintainability, testability, and code organization.

## Dependency Injection (DI)
GPSNote employs Dependency Injection, a design pattern that enables the separation of the creation of objects from their consumption. By using DI, the application promotes loose coupling between components, simplifying testing and enhancing the flexibility of the codebase.

## Additional Library
- **Prism:** Prism is utilized as an additional library in this project. It is a framework that assists in building loosely coupled, maintainable, and testable XAML applications. Prism aids in implementing MVVM patterns effectively, handling navigation, dependency injection, and other common tasks in modern application development.

## Features
- **Location-Based Notes:** Users can create and associate notes with specific GPS coordinates.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The application boasts an intuitive and user-friendly interface for creating, editing, and managing notes.
- **GPS Integration:** GPSNote integrates seamlessly with the device's GPS capabilities to accurately attach notes to specific locations.
- **Categorization:** Users can categorize and label their notes for better organization and easy retrieval.
- **Search and Filter:** The application offers search and filter functionality, allowing users to find notes quickly based on various criteria.
- **MVVM Architecture:** The use of MVVM architecture ensures separation of concerns, making the application's codebase more maintainable and extensible.
- **Dependency Injection:** Dependency Injection enhances code modularity and testability by managing object creation and their dependencies efficiently.
- **Prism Framework:** Utilizing the Prism framework simplifies common development tasks, like navigation and dependency injection, leading to more streamlined and maintainable code.
